ways of creating elements 
-------------------------

HTML
----

    <h1>hello-world</h1>

DOM in js
---------
let h1 = document.createElement("h1")
console.log(h1)
hi.textContext = "hello"

react
-----
React.createElement("tag-name" , {id : "demo"} " , "content")

eg:-
React.creatElement("h1" , "null" , "hello")

eg:-
React.createElement("div" , {id : "demo"} , React.createElement 
                        ("spam" , "null" , "hello"))



JSK (java-script XML)
---------------------
--> it is used to react html in react.
--> it is neither string nor html.

1)all the elements should be en-closed. ex:-<img/>
2)if there is a morethan one element it should be wrapped inside a parent element or fragment.
ex:- 
<div> --->parent
<h1>hello</h1>
<h2>hello</h2>
</div>

<> --->fragment (introduced in react 16.8) it is used to save memory in virtual dom. fragment doesnot take any memory where div tag will take.
<h1>hello</h1>
<h2>hello</h2>
</>

3) use {} for writting expression.



props in react
--------------

-->props stands properties.
-->props are immutable
-->props are used to send data from one component to another component
-->props are uni-direction.
-->props are read-only.
--> it is an object

states in reaact  -------------------------------


    -->State is used to store data in the component and update that data in the component
    -->States are mutabale (we can read and write )
    import {useState} from "react" 
    const [state ,setState ] = useState(initial)
    state --> used to stor initial value
    useState() --> used to update state value

styling in react 
----------------------------------------
    -->1) inline css
    -->2) glabally css
    -->3) external css!!!!!!!!!!!!
    
useRef hook in react
----------------------------------------
    --> useRef stands for reference
    -->uses the real dom 
    -->useRef is having a object called current
    --> uses ref keyword
    -->used in uncontrolled form 

    SYNTAXXXX:
        const ref = useRef(initialValue)

List and keys in react
----------------------
> list is used to iterate as array using map().
> keys are used to track an element.
> using key we can understand which element is create,updated

advantages
-->improves component effiecency.
-->improvers optimizion of the browser.

how to avoid props drilling
----------------------------------
    -->using useContext hook
    -->using higher order component
    -->using redux



useContext hook in react 
--------------------------------
    -->useContext is used to pass data from parent to child component 
        or from one component to another component without using props
    -->useContext is used to avoid prop drilling
    -->useContext is used to avoid passing props to each component

    SYNTAX:

    step 1: create a context and export it

    export const context = createContext(initialValue);

    step 2: use provider to pass the value

    <identifierName.provider value={data} >
        {children }
        <childComponent/>
    </identifierName.provider>



        const value = useContext(context)
        <context.Provider value={data}>
            <childComponent />
        </context.Provider>

    step 3: use consumer to consume the value given by the provider 
    import context from "./context"
    <identifierName.consumer>
        {
        cbf
        }
    </identifierName.consumer>

useEffect in react
------------------
> it is used to provide side effect for function based component.
> in react we can tell to component to perform something after component renders.
> used for updating a DOM.
> used as timer.
> used fetch an API.
> useEffect will avoids React life-cycle in CBC
    > componentDidMount()
    > componentDidUpdate()
    > componentWillUnmount()

Browser Routes in React
--------------------------------
    > BrowserRouter is used to enable client side routing in react.
    > it is use to interact from one component to multiple component.
    > Routes is a pre-defined componentused to wrap Route.
    > Route is pre-define component used for routing purpose.
    > Browser Router is a pre-default component used to wrap Routes.
    > useNavigate() it is used to navigate component.
    > useLocation() it is used to get the current location.
    > useMatch() it is used to get the current match.
    > useParmes() hook it is used to target 
    > <Link></Link> used for place-holder

what is single page application
--------------------------------
    >used to link one component to another component without a page-reloading

Higher order component
----------------------
--> it is an advsnce technique used to re-use component logic.
--> it is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with some additional
--> it is used to avoid props drilling.

SYNTAX

let newComponent = HigherOrderComponent(OriginalComponent)
